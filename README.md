# CHIP-8 Emulator

A CHIP-8 emulator built in C++ using WinAPI and GDI+.  
The display is rendered in the top-left corner of the window with a minimalistic, retro-inspired interface.

## How to Run

Make sure you have `g++` installed (e.g., via MinGW or MSYS2) and support for WinAPI and GDI+.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `src` directory:
   ```bash
   cd src

2. Build and run:
    **To Build and run the emulator**
    ```bash
   make
    ```
   OR
    
   **Cleans up object files and the executable**
   ```bash        
   make clean
   ```
